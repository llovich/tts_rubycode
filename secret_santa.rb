# is there a way to solve this one
# where you ask the user for a list of names and use space or comma
# to delimit each value / item of array
# then once you have the array, use it and a matching algorithm
# to create hash pairs

# easy way would be to create hash table w key and value set up
# then us loop to list matches but puts-ing key and value
